# One-to-One and Group Chat Application (with Spring Boot, Kafka, and WebSockets)

## Description:

This project implements a real-time chat application that enables users to engage in private conversations and group messaging. It provides a robust and scalable backend architecture leveraging Spring Boot for efficient server-side development. Key technologies employed include:

    Spring Boot: Streamlines development by simplifying application configuration and dependency management.
    Apache Kafka: Facilitates asynchronous messaging and message queuing, ensuring high-throughput communication for real-time features like chat updates.
    Spring Data JPA: Offers a seamless integration with the PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage and retrieval.
    PostgreSQL: Acts as the relational database management system, providing a reliable and scalable foundation to store user information, chat messages, and group details.
    Spring WebSocket: Enables two-way communication between the server and client, allowing users to send and receive messages in real-time, creating a dynamic chat experience.

Additionally, a simple frontend component developed with ReactJs is included to demonstrate the API's capabilities. This frontend can be further expanded to create a fully functional chat user interface according to one's specific requirements.

## Key Features:

    Private Messaging: Users can establish secure one-on-one conversations.
    Group Messaging: Enables communication within designated groups.
    Real-Time Updates: Message notifications are delivered instantly for a seamless chat experience.
    Scalable Architecture: The backend is designed to handle a growing user base without compromising performance.
